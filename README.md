A complete rewrite for one of the largest custom gamemodes, Versus Saxton Hale. [Originaly made by Eggman, released public on 1st February 2011](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=146884?t=146884)
VSH-Rewrite started its development by [Kenzzer](https://github.com/Kenzzer) at alpha stage on November 4th 2017, then continued by [42](https://github.com/FortyTwoFortyTwo) from 18th October 2018. Plugin then released public on September 17th 2019.

## Features
- +10 bosses all balanced with unique abilities, and can be expanded further from sub-plugins
- +5 modifiers that changes boss's ability/effect upside and downside to change gameplay, and can be expanded further from sub-plugins
- Config with +80 rebalanced TF2 weapons to keep VSH gamemode balanced for all class and weapons
- Instead of team winning from control point, dome is spawned to damage opposing team. As time passes in gameplay, dome gets smaller to kill any stallers
- Rank, increases and decreases on every boss win and death. The bigger the rank, the smaller the health pool, keeping skilled bosses a challenge to win with low health
